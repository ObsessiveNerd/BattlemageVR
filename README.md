Battlemage VR is a project that combines VR headsets, the Playstation Move controllers, and the Leap Motion hand tracker. In Battlemage VR you used your melee weapon (controlled by the PS Move controller) to fight
monsters and deflect incoming projectiles. The Leap Motion tracks your hand movements to cast various spells, such as fireball.

The technical portions of this project are working, but the content and polish has yet to be done.
